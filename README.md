# Party Game Companion App

### How it Started
This project started when I was at a friend's birthday party and we decided to do a couple of games and give out a price for the winner. We wanted to keep score during the games and did so by writing them down in a piece of paper. Everyone kept asking us for the score and who was currently on the lead.

### What it does
PGCo. is meant to be displayed to the whole group of players so that everyone can know where they stand and know how many points they have scored so far. It brings fairness and transparency to simple party games and makes it simple for the hosts' to keep track of everyone's score.

### Features
Along with a clear view of the "Leaderboard" there are modals to "Add Points" to a selected player, "Pick a Random Player" to participate in an activity of your choice, and a "Timer" that let's you set the time, play, pause and restart the timer.

**Hope it serves you well on your party games!**

PS: It could be a good idea to stream it on a TV or a bigger screen for everyone to see the leaderboard.
